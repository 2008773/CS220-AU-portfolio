**Liberal Arts First Year Student**  

Hello! My name is Emma Hailes. 

I am a first year Liberal Arts student in Essex. I am half Japanese and half British. I lived in England for a year when I was 10, but I spent most of my life in Japan. I decided to go to UK university to improve my English and to have a new life that will benefit me in the future, having so much more opportunities. I studied a foundation course online at Essex. I enjoyed meeting new people and it was definately a good experience to have classes with people from different countries.

## My research
### How human emotion change through watching sad films and how these changes may affect life
I studied a foundation course in 2020, and this was my research topic. I was looking at university website and found that there are studies about films and human relatioships. I am interested in this topic, so I decided to research more about it, mainly focusing on human emotions.I was curious as to why people like sad movies despite the fact that they make people cry. I was interseted in knowing what makes it enjoyable, as well as how humans deal with negative and happy emotions. As a result, I wanted to concentrate on sad films and how that affect people's life. 

Here is my work.
