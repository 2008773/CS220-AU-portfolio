## Emma Hailes
**Liberal Arts First Year Student**  

Hello! My name is Emma Hailes. 

I am a first year Liberal Arts student in Essex. I am half Japanese and half British. I lived in England for a year when I was 10, but I spent most of my life in Japan. I decided to go to UK university to improve my English and to have a new life that will benefit me in the future, having so much more opportunities. I studied a foundation course online at Essex. I enjoyed meeting new people and it was definately a good experience to have classes with people from different countries.
