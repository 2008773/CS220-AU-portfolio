## Emma Hailes
**Liberal Arts First Year Student**  

Hello! My name is Emma Hailes. 

I am a first year Liberal Arts student in Essex. I am half Japanese and half British. I lived in England for a year when I was 10, but I spent most of my life in Japan. I decided to go to UK university to improve my English and to have a new life that will benefit me in the future, having so much more opportunities. I studied a foundation course online at Essex. I enjoyed meeting new people and it was definately a good experience to have classes with people from different countries.

## My research
### How human emotion change through watching sad films and how these changes may affect life
I studied a foundation course in 2020, and this was my research topic. I was looking at university website and found that there are studies about films and human relatioships. I am interested in this topic, so I decided to research more about it, mainly focusing on human emotions. I was curious as to why people like sad movies despite the fact that they make people cry. I was interseted in knowing what makes it enjoyable, as well as how humans deal with negative and happy emotions. As a result, I wanted to concentrate on sad films and how that affect people's life.Research question is mainly devided into 4 parts.

### Research questions

・Why do people enjoy sad films?

・What do they enjoy about in sad films?

・What part of brain is functioning?

・What kind of differences do they have after watching sad fims?
